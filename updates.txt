- created PieChart component and attempts to get the pie chart
- mentioned on project page that TA will go over that tomorrow (so i'll wait and attend tomorrow's discussion to get that)
*Entries done in the Entries component*
- design of the entries (including the circles next to the functions)
- i have no idea how to make the percentage sign within the input box...

Bijun 5/25
-removed MyD3Components, bc it's bar chart. After getting the piechart layout in PirChartComponents.jsx, i think it's good to remove that barchart.
-progress chart appearance *i decided to build progress bar off of scratch, if anyone want to use ui components instead, feel free to make another component. :)*
-implementing NextButton and connecting to progress bar
-5/26: pie chart responsiveness and update total %
-changed value = {preVal} to placeholder = "0", so 0 won't be there when we input new values
-progress bar progresses when clicked next
